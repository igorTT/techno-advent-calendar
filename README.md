# React Advent Calendar with YouTube Tracks

## **Project Overview**

This project is a personalized advent calendar web application built using React. Each "door" of the calendar represents a day in December leading up to Christmas and reveals a techno track hosted on YouTube. The app features:

- A visually appealing advent calendar layout.
- Date-based unlocking of calendar doors.
- Embedded YouTube video players for each track.
- Persistent state using local storage to remember which doors have been opened.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy sharing and access.
